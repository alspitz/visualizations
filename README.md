* [rpy-animation.py](rpy-animation.py) can be used in conjunction with `axis_rotations_multiple.rviz` to generate an animation of the roll, pitch, and yaw of the multirotor in RViz. Required mesh files are not included; feel free to substitute your own.
* Run [hud/main.py](hud/main.py) for a display of some vehicle telemetry.
* [graphs/euler.py](graphs/euler.py) generates a figure visualizing Euler angles in various conventions, such as ZYX and ZXY.
